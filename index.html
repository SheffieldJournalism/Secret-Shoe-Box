      <h2>Bringing the past to the present...</h2>
      <p>Extinction: First it came for the dinosaurs, then it came for the craftsmen. In just a few hundred years, we English lost our fletchers, our blacksmiths and our candlestick makers, and if fate should work its way backwards through the lyrics of “Rub-a-Dub-Dub,” we may yet lose our butchers and our bakers, too. </p>

      <p>But what of our shoe shine boys? You may think our shoe shines boys are already lost, a fossil of our Dickensian inheritance, but you would be wrong.</p>

      <p>On Sheffield’s West Street there lives a man named Joe Dakin. A shoe shine boy in 21st century Britain, Joe is perhaps the last surviving member of his species, and he owns what claims to be the UK’s one and only shoe shine parlour.</p>

      <p>Visiting the Secret Shoe Box is like stepping into a Jurassic Park for endangered craftsmen. A gramophone plays, a flat-cap is perched on the workman’s head, and as Joe snaps his braces into place, work gets underway.</p>

      <h2>First steps</h2>

      <p>
      Asked how he got started in the shoe shine trade, Joe says he comes from a family of vintage clothes lovers and connoisseurs of fine footwear.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Me and my family live a vintage lifestyle,” he says, “so everything you see is authentic. I’ve always worn handmade footwear; I’ve always worn Doc Martens shoes and dressed as I do now.”
      </p>

      <p>
      Joe says he grew up as a “subculture kid” and worked in many of Sheffield’s famous thrift stores, such as Mooch Vintage on Division Street, before starting his own business. He says the idea for the Secret Shoe Box came to him when he noticed that customers would pay more for the shoes he had polished and repaired by hand. </p> </section>

    <section class="content">  <p>“One day I sat outside Mooch Vintage and made a lot of money from shoe shining, and it gave me an idea, it gave me the inspiration I needed, and that’s when I decided to embark on this shoe shine business that I have now.” </p>

      <p>
      Like a prophet, Joe has the air of a man who was put on earth to spread the gospel of fine shoes.

        “I’m very passionate about it,” he says. “I really like to see the transformations, the before and afters – that’s how I built my business.”
        Joe prides himself and his store on the antique, friendly atmosphere inside, and the 1900s-inspired furniture and décor which surrounds the “throne” (which is what he calls his shoe shining chair). </p>

          <p> “We like you to feel as if you’re coming into someone’s living room, not a shoe shop. The idea is to sit down, have a whisky from the bar or a coffee, and have your shoes shined.”
On Saturdays we have a lot of people mingling with each other in here. And there’s no kind of pushy sales involved or anything like that.”

      The Secret Shoe Box has seen a sharp increase in profits in the last six months, but asked if he has plans to expand his one-man shoe shine outfit, Joe says franchising isn’t for him. </p>

  <p> “I’d like to see what the next six months holds and then rethink, but I’d hate to lose the atmosphere by trying to replicate something that’s working very nicely here in a little pocket of Sheffield,” he says.
  “I’ve got no interest in franchising or anything like that. I can’t see the point of it. The shop would lose its character, its personality, which is what we set out to create, so my heart wouldn’t be in it.”

        <p>We’ve seen quite a large increase in profit in the last six months, in every area of the business, not just in this new venture but downstairs as well, so it’s working very well and we’ve got some good support from some good companies.”

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZzvEyUQyypY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


        <p>  From up in his shoe shine castle, Joe gives the impression of a great sage overlooking the students of West Street beneath him, whose cash-strapped frivolity he just can’t understand.
“I don’t see the point of paying 40, 50 pounds for a pair of shoes, wearing them for two months and then throwing them away, when you can buy a pair of shoes for 100, 200 pounds and there’ll last you 10 years. Or with proper products and proper shoe care, they’ll last you forever.” </p>

<p> “It started with social media, seeing a shoe that could be thrown in the bin being given a new life, and then seeing the customer’s face afterwards. That’s what drives me forward to do what I do."   </p>

<p> Asked what advice he has for young people today, Joe says: “If you want to be taken seriously, wear a nice pair of shoes.” </p>
